<p>An essential reference for ggplot is the <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf">Data Visualization with ggplot2</a>. It’s useful to have this handy.</p>
<div id="load-the-packages" class="section level1">
<h1>Load the packages</h1>
<p>If you don’t have them installed yet, then first install some packages:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(c(&quot;tidyverse&quot;, &quot;ggthemes&quot;, &quot;plotly&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>Then load ones we’ll be using</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
library(plotly)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="caveats" class="section level1">
<h1>Caveats</h1>
<p>This notebook is focused on getting you acquainted with <code>ggplot2</code> and <code>plotly</code>, not teaching good data visualization practices. Some of the plots created below are not necessarily the best way to visualize the example data sets.</p>
<p>Also, I’ve included the steps necessary to manipulate the original data into the form needed for plotting because this is a significant, but often ignored, part of learning how to make plots. The data manipulation steps aren’t covered in great detail, but the code is provided.</p>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level1">
<h1>Data</h1>
<p>Load the data we’ll be working with</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;babynames&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>library(babynames)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>head(babynames)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 × 7
##    year   sex      name     n       prop initial first2
##   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;

<p>Ok, so what’s a tibble? It’s a fancy <code>data.frame</code> that is part of the <code>tidyverse</code> (e.g. <code>dplyr</code>, <code>ggplot2</code>, etc.). It makes <code>data.frame</code>s a little nicer, like not printing all rows by default. You can use it like a <code>data.frame</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="example-1" class="section level1">
<h1>Example 1</h1>
<p>Let’s explore the proportion of names that begin with each letter</p>
<div id="get-the-data-to-plot" class="section level2">
<h2>Get the Data to Plot</h2>
<p>First, manipulate the data (the <code>dplyr</code> way)</p>
<pre class="r"><code>babynames &lt;- mutate(babynames, initial=substr(name, 1, 1))
initial_props &lt;- group_by(babynames, year, sex, initial) %&gt;% 
  summarize(count=sum(n), totalprop=sum(prop)) %&gt;%
  ungroup()</code></pre>
<p>Without <code>dplyr</code>, if you prefer:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>babynames$initial &lt;- substr(babynames$name, 1, 1)
initial_props &lt;- aggregate(babynames[,c(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;prop&quot;)], by=list(babynames$year, babynames$sex, babynames$initial), sum)
names(initial_props)&lt;- c(&quot;year&quot;, &quot;sex&quot;, &quot;initial&quot;, &quot;count&quot;, &quot;totalprop&quot;)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="simple-plot" class="section level2">
<h2>Simple Plot</h2>
<p>Ok, make a simple plot first. Let’s look at girls with letter A names:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>initial_props %&gt;% filter(sex==&quot;F&quot;, initial==&quot;A&quot;) %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(y=totalprop, x=year)) + geom_line()</code></pre>
<p><img src="code_with_answers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Or, without <code>dplyr</code></p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(initial_props[initial_props$sex==&quot;F&quot;&amp;initial_props$initial==&quot;A&quot;,], 
       aes(y=totalprop, x=year)) + geom_line()</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="multiple-lines" class="section level2">
<h2>Multiple lines</h2>
<p>Add in boys too - we want two different color lines, so we’ll use the <code>aes</code> parameter <code>color</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>initial_props %&gt;% filter(initial==&quot;A&quot;) %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(y=totalprop, x=year, color=sex)) + geom_line()</code></pre>
<p><img src="code_with_answers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Or, without <code>dplyr</code></p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(initial_props[initial_props$initial==&quot;A&quot;,], 
       aes(y=totalprop, x=year, color=sex)) + geom_line()</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="facets" class="section level2">
<h2>Facets</h2>
<p>Instead of just one letter, we could make a plot for each letter using facets:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(initial_props, aes(y=totalprop, x=year, color=sex)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~initial)</code></pre>
<p><img src="code_with_answers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Note that above, we split the plot creation commands on multiple lines. If you do this, make sure to end the line with a <code>+</code> or split within a <code>()</code> so that R doesn’t think you’re done with the line.</p>
<p>For facets, the options are <code>facet_wrap</code>, which automatically lays out rows and columns, or <code>facet_grid</code> which can be used to specify values to spread over rows or columns. Facets use the formula specification, which is <code>y~x</code>. So variables to the left of <code>~</code> specify layout down the y-axis (so appearing as rows), while variables to the right specify layout along the x axis (so appearing as columns) For <code>facet_wrap</code> you always just put the variable on the right of <code>~</code>. You can change the default layout with other options to the function. You can use facets with multiple variables.</p>
<p>You can see that by default all of the plots have the same axes – the same range. This lets you compare easily across plots, but you can change this.</p>
</div>
<div id="cleanupformatting" class="section level2">
<h2>Cleanup/Formatting</h2>
<p>Ok, now some plot cleanup:</p>
<p>Let’s rotate the year labels so that we can read them easier. The layout of the labels is part of the plot <code>theme</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(initial_props, aes(y=totalprop, x=year, color=sex)) +
  geom_line() + 
  facet_wrap(~initial) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -90, vjust=0.5))</code></pre>
<p><img src="code_with_answers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>And make better labels:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(initial_props, aes(y=totalprop, x=year, color=sex)) +
  geom_line() + 
  facet_wrap(~initial) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -90, vjust=0.5)) +
  labs(title=&quot;Baby Names First Initial&quot;, x=&quot;Year&quot;, y=&quot;Proportion of Babies&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="code_with_answers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The legend label has to be changed by reference to the color scale. You can change the x and y labels that way too instead of using <code>labs</code> (which is a convenience):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(initial_props, aes(y=totalprop, x=year, color=sex)) +
  geom_line() + 
  facet_wrap(~initial) +
  ggtitle(&quot;Baby Names First Initial&quot;) +
  scale_x_continuous(name=&quot;Year&quot;) +
  scale_y_continuous(name=&quot;Proportion of Babies&quot;) +
  scale_color_discrete(labels=c(&quot;Female&quot;,&quot;Male&quot;), name=&quot;Sex&quot;) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -90, vjust=.5)) </code></pre>
<p><img src="code_with_answers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Our y-axis is a little crowded, and we don’t need all of those gridlines:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(initial_props, aes(y=totalprop, x=year, color=sex)) +
  geom_line() + 
  facet_wrap(~initial) +
  ggtitle(&quot;Baby Names First Initial&quot;) +
  scale_x_continuous(name=&quot;Year&quot;) +
  scale_y_continuous(name=&quot;Proportion of Babies&quot;, 
                     breaks=c(0,.1,.2)) +
  scale_color_discrete(labels=c(&quot;Female&quot;,&quot;Male&quot;), name=&quot;Sex&quot;) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -90, vjust=.5),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) </code></pre>
<p><img src="code_with_answers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png" width="672" /></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="challenge-1" class="section level1">
<h1>Challenge 1</h1>
<p>Part 1: Make a similar plot as above, but group by sex instead of initial letter. Only plot names that begin with vowels. What formatting changes do you want to make?</p>
<p>Part 2: Then change the plot to a stacked area plot so you can see the total number of names starting with vowels over time. Hint: find the correct geom to use, then look at the help to find the option to make it stacked. Hint 2: the aesthetic <code>color</code> refers to line color. <code>fill</code> may be useful instead.</p>
<p>Note: The facet labels are pulled automatically from the names of the variable after it’s coverted to a factor. To change the labels (or the order of the groups), you have to change the factor. This is a little tricky. The answer will include this code, but you may want to leave those labels as is for now.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>filter(initial_props, initial %in% c(&quot;A&quot;,&quot;E&quot;,&quot;I&quot;,&quot;O&quot;,&quot;U&quot;,&quot;Y&quot;)) %&gt;%

<h1>Example 2</h1>
<p>Let’s look at unisex names. For reference: <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/there-are-922-unisex-names-in-america-is-yours-one-of-them/" class="uri">https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/there-are-922-unisex-names-in-america-is-yours-one-of-them/</a> and <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2013/09/25/the-most-unisex-names-in-us-history/" class="uri">http://flowingdata.com/2013/09/25/the-most-unisex-names-in-us-history/</a></p>
<div id="data-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>We’ll just look among the 1000 most common names by total count since 1950. We’ll define unisex names as ones with roughy equal numbers of men and women.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>topnames&lt;-babynames %&gt;% filter(year&gt;=1950) %&gt;% 
  group_by(name) %&gt;% 
  summarize(total=sum(n)) %&gt;%

  group_by(name, sex, total) %&gt;%
  summarize(sextotal=sum(n)) %&gt;%
  spread(key=sex, value=sextotal) %&gt;%
  mutate(ratio=(Male-Female)/total)</code></pre>
<p>without <code>dplyr</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>totalcounts&lt;-sort(tapply(babynames$n[babynames$year&gt;=1950], babynames$name[babynames$year&gt;=1950], sum), decreasing=TRUE)[1:1000]
topnames&lt;-data.frame(name=names(totalcounts), total=totalcounts)
topnames&lt;-merge(topnames, babynames)
topnames&lt;-topnames[topnames$year&gt;=1950, ]
topnames&lt;-aggregate(topnames$n, by=list(topnames$name, topnames$sex, topnames$total), sum)

topnames&lt;-spread(topnames, key=sex, value=sextotal)
topnames$ratio&lt;-(topnames$Male-topnames$Female)/topnames$total</code></pre>
<p>Note the use of <code>spread</code> from <code>tidyr</code> above. This is important because to make a scatterplot, we need to have our x and y values in different variables. We can’t easily separate x and y values by group (such as sex).</p>
</div>
<div id="scatterplot-to-find-unisex-names" class="section level2">
<h2>Scatterplot to Find Unisex Names</h2>
<p>Let’s use a plot to find unisex names. We’ll plot the number of boys with the name vs. the number of girls and look for names near the diagonal. Instead of aggreating the counts by gender first, we’ll let ggplot do it.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(topnames, aes(x=Male, y=Female)) + geom_point()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Warning: Removed 1 rows containing missing values (geom_point).</code></pre>
<p><img src="code_with_answers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>It looks like there might be a few, but none of the most common names (makes sense). We could try a log scale:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(topnames, aes(x=Male, y=Female)) + geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Warning: Removed 1 rows containing missing values (geom_point).</code></pre>
<p><img src="code_with_answers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Well that’s kind of interesting. The missing chunk in the bottom left is because the data set doesn’t have names where there were fewer than 5 people. Another approach: limit the range on the axes to just look at the bottom left corner:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(topnames, aes(x=Male, y=Female)) + geom_point() + 
  lims(x=c(0,250000), y=c(0,250000))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Warning: Removed 180 rows containing missing values (geom_point).</code></pre>
<p><img src="code_with_answers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The warning comes from setting limits on the x and y axis excluding some points.</p>
<p>Let’s add in a diagonal line for reference:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(topnames, aes(x=Male, y=Female)) + geom_point() + 
  lims(x=c(0,250000), y=c(0,250000)) +
  geom_abline(slope=1, intercept=0)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Warning: Removed 180 rows containing missing values (geom_point).</code></pre>
<p><img src="code_with_answers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Color points by how boy or girl they are, and let’s make them a little bigger</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(topnames, aes(x=Male, y=Female, color=ratio)) + 
  geom_point(size=2) + 
  lims(x=c(0,250000), y=c(0,250000)) +
  geom_abline(slope=1, intercept=0, color=&quot;gray60&quot;) +

<p>Now, for the points we care about, let’s label them. We could label all of them, but we really just want to label the points near the line:</p>

<h1>Example 3</h1>
<p>Continue as above, looking at unisex names, but make a bar chart.</p>
<p>We need the Male and Female columns back together in one, because we’re no longer plotting them against each other – instead, we’re grouping again. Use <code>gather</code> to undo what we did with <code>spread</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>topnames2&lt;-gather(topnames, key=&quot;sex&quot;,value=&quot;sextotal&quot;, Male, Female)</code></pre>
<p>We only want to look at the names that score the lowest on <code>ratio</code> (absolute value). And we already have the counts calculated, so we tell <code>geom_bar</code> that so it doesn’t try to do the counting itself.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(topnames2[abs(topnames2$ratio)&lt;.3 &amp; !is.na(topnames2$ratio),], 
       aes(x=name, y=sextotal, group=sex, fill=sex)) +

<p><img src="code_with_answers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-31-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Plot proportions instead of counts. And let’s use slightly different colors (there are different ways to specify colors, but below we use hex codes. See: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors" class="uri">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors</a>):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(topnames2[abs(topnames2$ratio)&lt;.3 &amp; !is.na(topnames2$ratio),], aes(x=name, y=sextotal, group=sex, fill=sex)) + 
  geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;, position=&quot;fill&quot;) +

<p>Lose the gray background with the minimal theme, and we don’t need horizontal grid lines for a bar chart:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(topnames2[abs(topnames2$ratio)&lt;.3 &amp; !is.na(topnames2$ratio),], aes(x=name, y=sextotal, group=sex, fill=sex)) +

<div id="themes" class="section level2">
<h2>Themes</h2>
<p>We used <code>theme_minimal</code> above to style the plot. This is one of the themes built into <code>ggplot2</code>. There are other themes available in the <code>ggthemes</code> package. First, a base plot without themes:</p>

  ggplot(aes(y=totalprop, x=year, color=sex)) +

  ggtitle(&quot;Baby Names Starting with A&quot;) </code></pre>
<p><img src="code_with_answers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-34-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Then, the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/">FiveThirtyEight</a> theme:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>initial_props %&gt;% 
  filter(initial==&quot;A&quot;) %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(y=totalprop, x=year, color=sex)) + 
  geom_line() +

  theme_fivethirtyeight()</code></pre>
<p><img src="code_with_answers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-35-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>With the Stata theme (if you want to fool your audience?)</p>
<pre class="r"><code>initial_props %&gt;% 
  filter(initial==&quot;A&quot;) %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(y=totalprop, x=year, color=sex)) +

<h1>Challenge 2</h1>
<p>Using <code>topnames</code>, make another scatterplot, but filter out names that aren’t unisex (use <code>ratio</code> and set the cutoff youself). Change the size (the area, not the radius) of the points to be scaled according to the total number of people with the name. Fix the legend title. Set the x and y axes to have the same limits. Apply a theme of your choice to the plot.</p>
<p>Hint: you need an option at the bottom of the scales section on the <code>ggplot2</code> cheatsheet.</p>

<h2><code>ggplotly</code></h2>
<p>One of the easy things you can do with plotly is use it with a plot from <code>ggplot</code> to add tooltips when you hover over points or lines. You can save <code>ggplot</code> plots as objects.</p>
<p>Let’s look at what’s going on with those A names by looking at the first two letters:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>babynames &lt;- mutate(babynames, first2=substr(name, 1, 2))
anames &lt;- babynames %&gt;%
  filter(initial==&quot;A&quot;) %&gt;%
  group_by(year, sex, first2) %&gt;% 
  summarize(count=sum(n), totalprop=sum(prop)) %&gt;%
  ungroup()
plot1&lt;-filter(anames, sex==&quot;F&quot;) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=totalprop, color=first2)) +
  geom_line()
plot1</code></pre>
<p><img src="code_with_answers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-41-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Note that this approach to pulling the data is going to miss years with no observations (say for names starting with “Aw” or other uncommon pairs). So our lines won’t be 100% accurate, but we’re just going to ignore that.</p>
<p>Now, this is a messy plot, with too many lines. It’s hard to distinguish the colors. But if we’re doing exploratory analysis, it might still be useful, if we could tell what each line is. This is where plotly comes in:</p>

<h2>Plotting with Plotly</h2>
<p>You can also make plots directly with plotly. Why? Maybe you want plots that are prettier than the base graphics but don’t like <code>ggplot</code>. I still recommend using <code>ggplot</code>, but you don’t have to.</p>
